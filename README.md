## 🏆 Motivation: The Anki Chess Story

Once upon a time, I fell in love with learning using Anki. The magic of spaced repetition made memorizing anything
feel like a superpower! But when it came to chess openings, flipping through static flashcards just wasn’t enough.
I wanted to practice my lines on a real chessboard, not just in my head.

So, I set out to build **Anki Chess**: a tool that combines the power of Anki’s algorithm with an interactive chess
interface. Now, you can learn and review chess openings just like you would with Anki—but with real moves, real
boards, and real fun! ♟️✨
